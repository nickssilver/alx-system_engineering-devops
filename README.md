# ALX Software Engineering and DevOps - Bash, Scripting, Shell permission, redirection, variables, expansions etc.
This repository contains programs written for the software engineering and DevOps track at ALX. In these projects, I worked with Bash and practiced writing Bash scripts to automate tasks. I learned about the OSI model and various Linux networking tools. 
The specific list of projects are as follows:

- 0x00. Shell, basics
- 0x01. Shell, permissions
- 0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters
- 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions
