# 0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and Filters
In this project, I learned about using **head**, **tail**, **find**, **wc**, **sort**, **uniq**, **grep**, and **tr** commands to redirect standard input and output and combine commands in the Shell. I learned about special characters, how they work and how to filter text from files.
